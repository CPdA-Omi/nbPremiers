# nbPremiers
A little experiment to try to make an optimised program wich calcul a certain number of prime numbers
The program will be write in many other programming languages later...

## How to use ?

All works with arguments (one or two)
---
- If one argument is given, the program tells you if it is prime or not
- If two arguments are given, the program gives you all the prime numbers between both (if the first is greater than the first

## Lua version differences
- If the first argument is lower than the second, both numbers will be swapped
- The messages, variables and commentaries are in english

Unfortnuately, all the system messages for the bash version are only in french for now. Changements from the lua version described above will soon be interated to the bash version.
